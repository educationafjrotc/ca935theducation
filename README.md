GENERAL POINTERS
    1. DO NOT CHANGE THE CLASSES, CSS, NON-TEXT CODE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND ARE CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABLITIES TO FIX ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY HAVE CAUSED. However, don't be afraid to add new features, just don't commit until you know it works. 

    2. External CSS, images, and fonts are stored in the static folder. Keep it like this.

    3. Every time you commit and push include a message with a detailed description of what has been changed.

    4. Github has a web editor. You can find it by clicking on one of the html files and then clicking on the arrow next to the pencil which is located at the top of the code. 

    5. For lack of a better description, the general theme of the website is "cute?". The color palette is in the static folder under images. 

    6. Use the font cocogoose for headers, louis_george_cafe for body text, and kollera ONLY for the title of the website in the navbar and footer.

    7. Keep the format of the code consistent. For example use either single or double quotes, stay consistent in your indents (I like to keep one indent for each tag it's inside of), and class naming style. Remember the website is only yours for a few academic years! Afterwards other people have to be able to maintain it. 


HOW TO UPDATE THE WEBSITE
    SCHOLARSHIPS.HTML & CURRENT_EVENTS.HTML
        1. To add a scholarship/current event to the website, first find the button with the month the scholarship is DUE in, not the one it is posted in.  

        2. Directly under that button is a div or "division" with <ul> and <li> tags. The <ul> tells HTML that an unordered list is being made and the <li> tells HTML to make a bullet point. Add an <li> </li> and paste the scholarship/current event between the tags. 

        3. Make sure you add <a> around any links. 

        4.  Before commiting, add the days the scholarships you added to the website were posted on the discord. So for example if you posted a scholarship on 2/15/24 and later added it to the website, say that you added a scholarship from 2/15/24 in the message before commiting the code. 

        5. Commit and Push! The website will take about a minute to show the changes you just made. 

    KNOWLEDGE.HTML
        1. Find the <h1> tag that says "Next Monday's Knowledge: "

        2. Change the text inside the <a> tag inside it to display the correct knowledge.

        3. Update the knowledge quizlet labeled "this week's knowledge"

        4. Before commiting, comment that you updated the knowledge and what it was updated to.

        5. Commit and Push! The website will take about a minute to show the changes you just made. 


IDEAS FOR FUTURE ADDITIONS

    1. Change the image on index.html to something else

    2. The fonts are in the same directory as the html files because firefox won't load them if they are in a different folder. If you find a way to get the page load properly and have the font files in the static folder please implement it.
