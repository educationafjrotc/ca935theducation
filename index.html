  <h3> Financial Aid: </h3>
  <p> 
  The importance of financial aid is becoming more apparent than ever. 
  Increasing cost of higher education is discouraging many students from pursuing higher education, 
  whether vocational or trade training or attending college. Many without financial aid are forced 
  to drop out or avoid higher education in general. However, scholarships provide a valuable source 
  of financial aid, meaning that students don’t have to be saddled by debt, and can achieve their 
  version of academic success. Students often aren’t aware that they have so many scholarships 
  available to them:  local scholarships offered by community organizations to internationally 
  recognized awards. We introduce students to those scholarships! Everyone should be able to 
  achieve their academic goals, and our work guarantees that higher education is more accessible 
  and affordable for all.
  </p>
